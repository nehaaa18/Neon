<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Terms of Use</u></h1>
   <p>These are the general terms and conditions on which we supply all our services. If you use our services, you agree to abide by these terms.</p>
   <br>
   <p>At Neon fashion we supply a lot of different services. Some of them will have specific terms tailored for them. If that is the case, Neon Fashion's contract with you for that service will be on these terms, supplemented by any terms specific to the service. In the case of any conflict, service specific terms will take precedence.</p>
   <br>
   <p>We process personal data in accordance with our privacy policy. As part of this agreement you consent to our doing so. You should read the policy carefully, especially if you have any concerns about your privacy.</p>
   <br>
   <p><b>Warning: unless we have agreed a particular level of service with you, we make absolutely no promises about the quality or existence of any of our services . Please read the sections below and our general exclusion of liability.</b></p>
   <br>
   <p>All use of our web services are subject to our terms for web users. There are further terms if you have signed up for an account with one of our services and, if you have agreed to pay us for a service, please see the additional terms for paid-for services. At the end are some general terms and definitions.</p>
   <br>
   <p>If you believe there may be illegal content hosted on our web services please let us know at info@neonfashion.com</p>

<h1>What you agree</h1>
<p>You agree not to use our websites to do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Anything which is illegal either where you are in the world, or where we are.</li>
	<li>Cause nuisance to other users of our services.</li>
	<li>Interfere with the normal running of our services.</li>
	<li>Try to access our systems in a way other than those advertised by us and, in particular, to use a web crawler that does not respect the robots exclusion policy.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Accounts</h1>
<p>Some of our services require you to create an account in order to make certain kinds of, or any, use of the service. All our accounts are subject to the following rules.</p>

<p>You must be at least 13 years old and a human being.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If asked for any personal details, you must answer truthfully (see our privacy policy for what we do with those details). You must supply us with a valid e-mail address.</li>
	<li>You are responsible for the security of your accounts and making sure that any contact details in the account are kept up to date. If we need to contact you but are unable to do so, for example because your e-mail address is no longer valid, then any consequences of that failure will be your responsibility.</li>
	<li>You must not let anyone else use your account. If pressure is applied to you to do so — for example if an employer demands your username and password — please inform them that their attempt to subvert your agreement with us will mean that they have no permission to use any of our services. We may take action, including criminal prosecution, if they use our services using an account they have obtained in this way.</li>
	<li>You must let us know of any unauthorised use of your account as soon as you are able to after becoming aware of it.</li>
	<li>Unless an account is associated with a paid-for service, we may suspend or terminate it at any time. Equally, you may close your account at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Community memebers</h1>
<p>By registering as a community member, you are acknowledging your connection to us. You are subject to any rules for community members we may publish and we may send you email messages we think appropriate for members, for example in order to poll you on some important issue.</p>
<br>
<p>Community membership is not membership in the formal sense of membership of a company limited by guarantee.</p>
<h1>Liability</h1>
<h2>Indemnities-where you may owe us</h2>
<p>If you breach any of your obligations under this agreement and, as a result, cause us to be sued by anyone else, you will have to compensate us for any loss we have suffered as a result, which includes any costs, such as paying lawyers, or for our own time, we incur defending a claim as well as any damages awarded.</p>
<br>
<p>If your breach causes you to be sued by someone else, you will not sue us for any loss you suffer as a result.</p>
<br>
<h2>Exclusion-what we do not owe you</h2>
<p>We limit our liability in several different ways — all of which we believe to be fair. In case any one of them is found to be unenforceable by a court, each of the following limitations of liability is separate and our liability to you is limited by all of them.</p>
<br>
<p>All exclusions of liability are only in so far as we are allowed to do so by whatever law applies to the situation. For example, the law of England and Wales prevents us from excluding our liability for any personal injury or death caused by our negligence. We do not exclude such liability.</p>
<br>
<p>We will not be liable for any damage that was not reasonably foreseeable at the time we made this agreement.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Any liability to you is limited by the amount you have paid us for a service, where:</li>
	<li>Our liability is zero for a free service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where you make periodic payments, our liability is limited to the value of the last payment you paid us.</p>
<p>We are not liable for any loss which is indirect or consequential. That includes any loss of business or profit.</p>
<p>We exclude, in so far as we are allowed, any warranties that would be implied by law.</p>
